review
It was a really great experience for me and my friends. The pizzas were delicious. Desserts were on top. I would love to go there again and again. I would definitely visit it again. The view from there was also awesome.
"I recently visited a pizza place near Marines named Pizza by the Bay , and while the food was average, the ambiance made up for it. The views were absolutely stunning, offering a perfect backdrop for a relaxed dining experience."
"During my recent visit to Mumbai, I had the pleasure of dining at Pizza By the Bay, a charming restaurant overlooking the scenic Marine Drive. The location itself is a major highlight—sitting by the large windows"
I think it is pretty hyped place. There are large crowd that comes and it gets noisy. The cost is too high and service okay.
"Worst experience, We are from Hyderabad and visited this place looking at the hype on social media. Pathetic place and staff. "
The location and ambiance of the place are really nice. We ordered the watermelon feta salad and the pepperoni pizza. 
"Came for breakfast and they happily served us even though we were a bit late for the 10:45am breakfast cut-off, food was tasty and reasonably priced"
Surprisingly the place was good. The sandwich was filling and good. The coffee was fresh. 
"Really bad Pizzas for someone who has ""Pizza"" in their name. Anyone would expect above average pizza if you name yourself ""Pizza by the Bay""."
Wonderful restaurant! I never had this delicious pizza ever .
